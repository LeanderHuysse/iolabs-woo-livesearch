All gilt-captioned \"Eruzioni dell'Etna\" or \"Terremoti successivi all'eruzione 1789\", and with additional, explanatory captions laid on the negatives and thus part of the photos. The photos were made under very difficult circumstances, mainly due to the unstable terrain, heat and sulphurous damps. The author, Orazio Silvestri (1835-1890) was an Italian geologist and volcanologist. He graduated in Pisa in philology and literature. Later he devoted himself to the study of natural sciences at the Scuola Normale Superiore, in Pisa, and for a time, he taught natural history at a high school in the same city. In 1862 he became assistant professor of industrial chemistry at the University of Naples. During that time he developed an interest in the geology and mineralogy of Mount Vesuvius, perhaps the most (in)famous volcano in the  world. In 1863, he organized the first chemical laboratory of the University of Catania. The eruption of Mount Etna in 1865 turned his attention back to volcanology. Between 1874 and 1877 he was professor of chemistry at the Technological Industrial Museum of Turin. Then he returned to the University of Catania, to the chair of geology and mineralogy. He organized the new \u2018Institute Volcanologico\u2019 and promoted the founding of the \u2018Servizio geodinamico dell'Etna\u2019 with its purpose to observe and study the seismic and eruptive phenomena of the most famous Sicilian volcano. This 1879 publication deals with the May-June eruption and earthquakes which caused much damage. Very rare; OCLC reports only one copy, in the Biblioteca R. Malaroda in Torino. This copy is described as having three earthquake plates with, respectively, 4, 4, and 3 photos. Since the photos on our two plates are numbered 1-3, 5-7, 10 and 12, we assume that the Turino copy may not be complete either, and the total number should be 12. Some shelf wear to the boards, the photos all clean, with clear impressions. Except for the lack of the final earthquake leaf an excellent copy. The Cat.

Besides the usual European herbs and medicinal plants, the book describes and illustrates mushrooms, fruit trees and other trees, as well as tropical peppers, cacti, fruits, nuts, tobacco, papyrus, etc.,  and even a coral. It made an important contribution to systematic botany by defining the parts of plants in general. The \"Cruydt-Boeck\", not to be confused with the \"Cruydeboeck\" first published in 1554, was largely a Dutch translation of the \"Stirpium historiae pemptades sex, libri XXX\", first published by Plantin at Antwerp in 1583. The \"Stirpium\" represents Dodoens's best and last great work: a monumental botanical study divided into six large sections, each containing five books, with the plants classified in 26 groups. This system was far superior to all his earlier classifications. Joost van Raveling[h]en or Justus Raphelengius (1573-1628) at Leiden, Christophel Plantin's grandson, first published the present translation in 1608, adding extra information in a smaller type at the end of each chapter. These additions give information on the qualities of the plants taken from the \"Cruydeboeck\" (if they are not present in the \"Stirpium\"), as well as new information or descriptions of new plants taken from the work of other authors, including Carolus Clusius and Mathias de Lobel. At the end Van Ravelingen added a whole new part on exotic plants taken from the works of Clusius, Garcia da Orta, Nic. Monard\u00e8s, Chr. Acosta and others. Willem Swanenburgh engraved the title-page, originally for the 1608 edition. It has a view of a botanical garden (with cacti, palm trees and other exotic plants) in an architectural frame with garlands of fruit and roundel portraits of Dodoens and Clusius, with the letterpress text in two cartouches. It is here coloured by an early hand. The present edition includes the same woodcuts as the first Dutch edition, with some additions for the parts by Clusius. The main text is set in textura type, and each of the thirty books begins with a headpiece of arabesque fleurons, a large decorated initial letter, and an introductory text in fraktur type.

Subjects are geographical, topographical, and\/or geological. The series was founded by the cartographer August Heinrich Petermann (1822-1878), and bore his name until its discontinuation in 2004. \"Petermann was responsible for drawing most of the maps in the first few years of the journal. His strength was in the analysis and evaluation of all sources available. As such one can say that the indication \"Originalkarte\" (original map) in many titles was well earned, for few slavishly copied what explorers or other experts had sketched\" (Wikipedia). Peterman standardized the maps by always using the metric system, and the Greenwich meridian as prime reference. As well as geographical maps, these volumes include several views, profiles and even some anthropological illustrations. In the rear of volume 9 there are two \"Erg\u00e4nzungshefte\": publications outside the series, but sometimes included. The last three volumes have a different - also contemporary - binding.

These were the first open air atomic detonations on the Bikini Atoll. The photographs most probably come from the personal collection of John T. \"Chick\" Hayward (1908-1999), a decorated aviator who later became a Navy vice admiral and who participated in the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. He was born in New York. As a youth, he was a batboy for the New York Yankees baseball team. When he was 16, he joined the Navy after being expelled from military school for disciplinary reasons and dropping out of high school. He was such an exemplary seaman that he was one of the few enlisted men accepted by the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1930. In the early part of World War II, he flew dozens of bombing missions in the South Pacific before participating in the Manhattan Project. Admiral Hayward joined the Manhattan Project at the China Lake Naval Ordnance Test Station in California in 1944. He helped develop the implosion components of the bomb dropped over Nagasaki, Japan. He was not involved in the development of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima three days earlier. After the war, he went to Japan to study the aftereffects on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. In 1946, he was in charge of the first attempt to photograph a nuclear explosion on the Bikini atoll, with equipment that shot 800,000 frames per second. In the early 1950s, he helped plan atomic weapons laboratory work at Los Alamos and Sandia. He also worked on the foundation of the Livermore Laboratory program in 1952 in close collaboration with Edward Teller. Over the years, he had worked on systems for ground- and air-launched rockets and became a pioneer in the development of weapons used to fight submarines. He also commanded the first nuclear-powered task force in naval history, leading the aircraft carrier Enterprise. Admiral Hayward served as president of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, from 1966 until retiring from active duty in 1968. He later worked for General Dynamics as a vice president for international programs. His Navy decorations included two awards of the Distinguished Service Medal and the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal. These photos document the first Bikini atoll explosions, known as the Operation Crossroads, \"Able\" and \"Baker\" events. Operation Crossroads was a series of nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States in the summer of 1946. Its purpose was to investigate the effect of nuclear weapons on naval ships. The series consisted of two detonations, each with a yield of 23 kilotons. The first photo records Test Able, which was detonated at an altitude of 520 feet (158 m) on July 1, 1946. The second photo is from Test Baker, which was detonated 90 feet (27 m) underwater on July 25, 1946. American, German, and Japanese battleships are in the foreground, earmarked for tested destruction. A third burst, Charlie, planned for 1947, was cancelled primarily because of the Navy's inability to decontaminate the target ships after the Baker test. The Crossroads tests were the fourth and fifth nuclear explosions conducted by the United States (Trinity, in the New Mexico desert was first, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the second and third). They were the first of many nuclear tests held in the Marshall Islands, and the first to be publicly announced beforehand and observed by an invited audience, including a large press corps. Admiral Hayward was in charge of photographing the two detonations seen on these two pictures. Original file numbers, release dates and further information are printed on the print versos \"IT FLIES THROUGH THE AIR WITH THE GREATEST OF HEAT - The atom bomb burst, in its test of the fleet. Looking for all the world like a giant cauliflower head suspended to an ever-stretching neck, Bikini's billowing cloud of smoke and flame was caught in its various stages of formation by a Navy patrol bomber flying just beyond range of the deadly explosion..\". This remarkably poetic text on the back suggest a great admiration for these weapons of mass destruction. The photographer(s) of these were close enough to the detonation that they were exposed to radioactive contamination. \"Able\" was the first detonation at Bikini Atoll. It required that the entire native population be relocated, which is still controversial. They were told they could return but the island is still too radioactively contaminated to this day. Both photos are of great historical value. Very light marginal creasing, otherwise fine. Very rare. Also present are \"How to photograph an atomic bomb\" published by VCE, Inc in 2006 and a copy of \"Bluejacket Admiral\" by John T. Hayward and C.W.

Omaha, Nebraska, the largest city in Nebraska, is named after them. Never known to take up arms against the U.S., the Omaha assisted the U.S. during the American Civil War\" (Wikipedia). According to Bonaparte, there were 1,121 Omaha in 1883. These ethnographic albumen prints of Native Indians were commissioned by Prince Roland Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte (1858-1924), and photographed by Alfred Ayotte. Roland Bonaparte was the son of Prince Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte and Justine Eleanore Ruflin. He was a grandson of Lucien Bonaparte, brother of Emperor Napoleon the First. He had a keen interest in anthropology and was president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9de G\u00e9ographie from 1910 until his death. He was also one of the founders of the French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9de Sp\u00e9l\u00e9ologie, and a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences.

The insects (published in 1869) are by the Dutch entomologist Samuel Constantinus Snellen van Vollenhoven (1816-1880) and the Belgian entomologist and ornithologist Baron Edmond de S\u00e9lys Longchamps (1813-1900). Snellen described new species of Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera; Deslongchamps a new genus and two new species of Odonata. The Crustacea and Echinodermata are by C. K. Hoffmann (published in 1874), and include species from R\u00e9union. The plates are not coloured in this part. Finally, the Mollusca of Madagascar and R\u00e9union are treated by J. G. de Man (1877). Included are marine, freshwater and terrestrial species, with beautifully coloured plates. The original printed front wrappers of all three sections, and the rear wrapper of the Insecta - with the printed prospectus - are bound in in the rear. The wrapper edge of the Mollusca is reinforced with Japanese paper. The front pastedown has two bookplates: the armorial bookplate of C. J. Koldewey, co-author of \"Feathers to brush. The Victorian bird artist John Gerrard Keulemans 1842-1912\" (published in 1982), and the small, oval bookplate of J. C. Puls, \"Pharmacien & Droguiste\" in Gand, Belgium. The two insect plates, with colourful beetles and butterflies, are double; on the first, two original drawings by the great Dutch-British zoology illustrator Keulemans are tipped in, on the second, one original butterfly plate is tipped in.

After a long career in Cambodia and Cochinchina, Pavie became the first French vice-consul in Luang Prabang in 1885, eventually becoming the first Governor-General and plenipotentiary minister of the newly formed French colony of Laos\" (Wikipedia). The work is separated into three parts: 'Various studies' ('\u00c9tudes diverses'), in three volumes, including one on the zoology of the area with contributions by several experts and with many new species that are often splendidly illustrated; 'G\u00e9ographie et voyages', in seven volumes, with many fine maps, and an atlas with another ten large scale maps. Except for the atlas, all volumes are richly illustrated in the text, mainly with photos, a few volumes more dominantly with engravings.

Over 200 photos are from Ecuador, several showing volcanoes, including some with mission crew-members amidst fumaroles. Other photos are anthropological, showing the people of the (high) Andes, as well as from the Amazon region, and people in cities such as Lima, Santiago, and Quito. Pictures include the Trans-Andeian railroad (several views); views of harbours (Valparaiso, Callao), streets, bridges, statues, a Roman Catholic procession, the army of Equador, and of Chile, on parade. A few show maps, with the expedition's itineraries.

[his] work is evocative of the New Zealand bush and his work often contained Maori motifs. Lloyd exhibited with the Auckland Society of Arts in 1883, 1896, 1898, 1899 and 1907 and in 1927 at the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts. Some examples of his work are available online. Lloyd was employed as an illustrator for New Zealand Illustrated Magazine from November 1901 until its last edition in 1905 (in which he was acknowledged). He also worked as an illustrator for Auckland Weekly News and as a cartoonist for The New Zealand Herald, retiring in 1936 after 34 years\" (Wikipedia). The first sketchbook mainly shows a) scenes and people, observed and drawn by Lloyd during a boat trip, perhaps on a ferry; and b) spectacular solitary trees and ferns, in rectangular frames. The latter seems to be one of his favourite subjects: several New Zealand museums and art galleries possess tree etchings in his hand, and at least one of the drawings in this manuscript can be identified as the basis of one of his etchings. The former are not without humour: a harbour scene has, in the margin, the sketch of a surprised looking young girl, captioned \"He's drawing in ink\". Trevor Lloyd was, after all, also one the country's leading cartoonists. Of his India ink sketches those of landscapes are quite detailed; those of people more sketched -some in pencil. Among the pencilled illustrations is one of a cat sleeping in a man's arm, captioned \"the prisoner\", which left us to wonder who the prisoner was: the cat, or the man? The second sketchbook contains fine, balanced, crayon illustrations of New Zealand landscapes, and people, many captioned with the name of the location (e.g. Whale Island, in the Bay of Plenty, or Umu-Pura Pura, or a short description of the situation (e.g. \"\"One of our backbones\"\", \"A warm day\").

Mesmer named it \"animal magnetism\", but it soon became to be better known as mesmerism. This manuscript was most probably written by Mesmer's French student, Nicolas Bergasse (1750-1832), based on Mesmer's thoughts and writings. In many ways, this copy is similar to the printed copy (with engraved text) in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France[http:\/\/gallica.bnf.fr\/ark:\/12148\/bpt6k107858b], and the copy in the in the Norman collection, but differs considerably because it includes the unique, long [8 pp.] preface. it also differs in some other details, the most noticeable being the presence of a lightning conductor on the right tower depicted in figure 7, and the absence of a script title page \"Th\u00e9orie du monde et des \u00e9tres organis\u00e9s suivant les principes de M***\" (dated 1784), which is very similar to the title used by Bergasse for the printed edition, namely \"Consid\u00e9rations sur le magn\u00e9tisme animal, ou, sur la th\u00e9orie du monde et des \u00eatres organis\u00e9s, d'apr\u00e8s les principes de M. Mesmer\", which was dated and distributed in 1784. The preface of this manuscript does not form part of the printed edition, or any later edition, so we assume it to be a precursor, abandonned in later editions for an unknown reason. It could have been the basis or transcript of lectures by Mesmer or Bergasse. It contains a review of the development of scientific knowledge, culminating, of course, in the great recent insights and discoveries by Mr. Mesmer.  Bergasse was \"...a French lawyer, philosopher, and politician, whose activity was mainly carried out during the beginning of the French Revolution during its early Monarchiens phase. \"After studying philosophy and law, Bergasse became a lawyer at the Parlement of Paris. He was very interested in the Enlightenment and in particular meeting Siey\u00e8s and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In 1781, he became a disciple of Franz Mesmer, and published in 1784 a systemization of Mesmerism titled Consid\u00e9rations sur le magnetisme animal. ... In 1789, he was elected Deputy of the Estates-General and become an important face of the Monarchiens Party. During the French Revolution, he created an particular political and constitutional thought inspired by the British and American models and develops a theory of the sovereignty of universal reason. He delivered an important report to the National Assembly on the organization of justice. He survived the Reign of Terror, but stopped active policy.\" (Wikipedia). Since Mesmer himself was not fluent in French, it is likely that Bergasse, his principle \"\u00e9l\u00e8ve\", edited the French text, probably of both the preface, and the main work. The main work contains about 100 special hieroglyph-like symbols each representing an important key word. A separate list of these symbols, and their meaning, was supplied to only a few people in order to keep the contents secret and render the text useless to anyone without a key: \"The occult symbols used throughout have an affinity to alchemical and other magical symbols.  They were 'generally considered as magic hieroglyphs, capable of communicating primitive truths'.\" (Darnton). \"The theory attracted a wide following between about 1780 and 1850, and continued to have some influence until the end of the century. In 1843 the Scottish physician James Braid proposed the term hypnosis for a technique derived from animal magnetism; today this is the usual meaning of mesmerism ...  In his first years in Paris, Mesmer tried and failed to get either the Royal Academy of Sciences or the Royal Society of Medicine to provide official approval for his doctrines. He found only one physician of high professional and social standing, Charles d'Eslon, to become a disciple. In 1779, with d'Eslon's encouragement, Mesmer wrote an 88-page book, M\u00e9moire sur la d\u00e9couverte du magn\u00e9tisme animal, to which he appended his famous 27 Propositions. These propositions outlined his theory at that time. Some contemporary scholars equate Mesmer\u2019s animal magnetism with the Qi (chi) of Traditional Chinese Medicine and mesmerism with medical Qigong practices. According to d'Eslon, Mesmer understood health as the free flow of the process of life through thousands of channels in our bodies. Illness was caused by obstacles to this flow. Overcoming these obstacles and restoring flow produced crises, which restored health. When Nature failed to do this spontaneously, contact with a conductor of animal magnetism was a necessary and sufficient remedy. Mesmer aimed to aid or provoke the efforts of Nature. To cure an insane person, for example, involved causing a fit of madness. The advantage of magnetism involved accelerating such crises without danger\" (Wikipedia). In the manuscript paper, we find the water mark of Jarel-Laroque, a mill in Couze-et-Saint-Front, active since the 16th century; and an unidentified water mark with two lions holding a shield with a saltire. The paper-quality is excellent, the manuscript neat, easily readable, and the illustrations are fine and detailed. A very good item.

A rare (super) complete set including the 5th volume (with index and corrections) that was published much later (1862) and is often lacking. The second volume has a six pp. description of the Berghaus Atlas, often not recorded. The third volume is here present in two parts, with pp. 305-309 printed twice, another rarely noted fact. This set also has the original 1851 atlas by Bromme, not the later (1861) \"Volksausgabe\", which has less text. Plate 6 is in the version revised by von Humboldt. According to Keller, von Humboldt planned this work for 50 years and regarded it as his magnum opus. He saw nature as a whole and man as a part of nature. The outlines of Humboldt's view of the universe - or, in Humboldt's words, \"the picture of nature\" - are presented in the first volume, with details appearing in the third and fourth volumes. The third volume focuses on astronomy and the fourth on geology. The fifth volume is the much later published index (1862), which is very often lacking. An excellent set. Fore edges of the text volumes uncut. A few small spots, mostly in the margins, one larger stain to plate 6 (from before binding); small library label and vague stamp on atlas title.

At the same time, it is an outstanding cornerstone of international Paleolithic research. The book presents an ingenious synthesis of primary data from Schmidt\u2019s own fieldwork and the state of research of his time. Special emphasis is given to Schmidt\u2019s fieldwork in the Swabian Jura in 1906, especially at Sirgenstein Cave, and to his field campaigns between 1907 and 1908 at the Ofnet Caves in the Bavarian part of Swabia. Even 100 years after its publication, the key aspects of Schmidt\u2019s cultural stratigraphic sequence remain valid today. He also succeeded at contextualizing his research from southwestern Germany within a broader European setting and established many explicit correlations between the well-studied French and German records of human biological and cultural Evolution. Schmidt\u2019s research is outstandingly modern in that it consciously addressed archaeological questions within the context of ecological and paleoanthropological research and followed a distinctive interdisciplinary approach that is reflected today 64 in the fact that the field of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology remains part of the University of T\u00fcbingen\u2019s Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. The presence of two chapters from the natural sciences within the book, one on geological and faunal analyses by E. Koken and one on anthropological remains by A. Schliz, documents this approach. Until today, no comparable oeuvre synthesizing the state of knowledge of the German Paleolithic within its European setting has been published. R. R. Schmidt must be regarded as one of the leading international pioneers of Paleolithic archaeology and Quaternary research as well as the founder of academic prehistory at the University of T\u00fcbingen with its emphasis on interdisciplinary research, curation of collections, and museum exhibits that demonstrate the importance of human evolution and Stone Age archaeology for the general public\u201d ('100 Jahre Robert Rudolf Schmidts 'Die diluviale Vorzeit Deutschlands', Bolus & Conard, 1912).

Die Geologie und Tierwelt der pal\u00e4olithischen Kulturst\u00e4tten Deutschlands; III. Anthropologischer Teil von A. Schliz. Die diluvialen Menschenreste Deutschlands.

The main objective of this short survey was to test the equipment. Longer expeditions followed to the same region (1881, 1882), the coastal region of Portugal (1881, 1882), the Mediterranean (1881) and the eastern Atlantic from Bayonne to the Canary Islands (1882). In 1883 the Travailleur was replaced by the Talisman, a more modern and larger vessel, which was used on a final expedition to the Sargasso Sea. The fishes collected were studied by Vaillant, who published the results in this volume, which was the first of a larger series of zoological publications.

This manuscript deals with his travels to China, published in two volumes as \"Notes de voyage: En Chine (1920-1921)\" (Paris, Artheme Fayard, 1924).

The Dutch anatomist, anthropologist and palaeontologist Marie Eug\u00e8ne Fran\u00e7ois Thomas Dubois (1858-1940) was the first to deliberately search for hominid fossils, and the first to be successful at it. Dubois' discovery was proof that humans were as much the subject of evolution as any other animal or plant. This edition precedes the edition from \"Jaarboek van het Mijnwezen\" and its offprint, which were both published in 1895. Dubois immediately realized the great importance of his discovery and could not wait for the \"Jaarboek\" to be published, let alone for a thorough description of all the mammalian fossils found at the Trinil site. In the preface, dated January 1894, Dubois stated \"F\u00fcr die Abfassung einer einigermaassen vollst\u00e4ndigen Beschreibung ist die Vergleichung der gesammelten Fossilien mit \u00e4hnlichen Sammlungen, namentlich in europ\u00e4ischen Museen... erforderlich - und so wird die Ver\u00f6ffentlichung jener Beschreibung und der in mancher Beziehung wichtigen allgemeineren Untersuchungsergebnisse wahrscheinlich nog l\u00e4ngere Zeit ausbleiben m\u00fcssen.

It took Dubois and his fossils many years to convince the majority of the scientific world of the importance of these findings, and today it is universally regarded as a cornerstone in human palaeontology and evolution. This edition was printed at and published by the \"Landesdruckerei\" [actually Landsdrukkerij in Batavia, or modern-day Jakarta]. Very few copies of this edition are known to exist.

This edition contains the Gesner\/Camerarius suite of woodcuts. Gesner had been preparing material for a massive historia plantarum but died before finishing the task; Camerarius acquired the material, used Gesner's woodcuts and supplemented them with his own. They are remarkable in their scientific detail, especially the enlarged depictions of floral structure, seeds, and fruit. This is the first time that such representation was consistently followed, and marks the beginning of what much later became a convention in scientific botanical illustration, when the taxonomic importance of these details was fully appreciated. They first appeared in Camerarius\u2019 recension of Mattioli's \"De plantis epitome utilissima\" of the same year (which is a different text than the above, and not merely a Latin version of the same). In addition to the botanical woodcuts, the German edition contains seven woodcuts of distilling apparatuses. In the Vorred (preface), Camerarius describes in detail the edition history of this book, and of the woodblocks in particular. Not all of the Gesner woodblocks were finished when Camerarius set out to edit Mattioli\u2019s text. In supervising the cutting of the already executed designs of the blocks, he took great care in assuring they were botanically correct. He gives a list of woodcuts already finished, but not botanically correct, and describes how the depicted configurations and shapes of leaves differ from nature. The fine title woodcut has, within an oval at top, a female figure seated and feeding a snake, with the motto \"Bonae Valetudini Digatum\"; on bottom there is another oval containing a fine small agricultural scene, with a tree surrounded by a woven fence and the motto, \"Wan Gott Wil \/ Spes\", the whole surrounded by another motto, \"Omnia Florebunt Pros piciente Deo\"; the compartment is inscribed at the bottom left with \"C.

As usual with works dealing with fossils, there was just one, uncoloured, edition. It was sold, in 1866, for 250 French francs: by far the most expensive of all uncoloured works on Mollusca. Only the hand-coloured edition of F\u00e9rrussac and Deshayes' \"Histoire naturelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et particuli\u00e8re des mollusques\" was more expensive, at 490 francs, discounted from a previous and astonishing 1250 francs. The fine plates with large, detailed figures, are by Delahaye, Formant, Lackenbauer, and Levasseur. Most specimens have a detailed enlarged illustration, a life-size outline figure, and, often, a further enlarged sculpture detail; in the bivalves usually the taxonomically important hinges. Like most of his works, this one is important because of the many new species and detailed illustrations. The \"Discription\" is one of the few works completed by the author, and includes simple plate numbering. Deshayes started many projects, but several remained unfinished and the plate numbering, for instance in his work on the molluscs of Algeria, was usually confusing. In this work, however, there are only two \"bis\" plates. The last page of volume 3 contains a list of publication dates of the 50 livraisons, recording the first two as from 2 November 1856, and the last two (49 and 50) from 15 December 1865. Only the last title page and wrapper bear the year 1866. This work is truly rare, and possibly even Deshayes' rarest work.

Isaac Newton published his famous theory of light and colours in volume 6 (no. 80) of the Transactions. It was a publication that shook the scientific world of that day, and is still considered one of the cornerstones of science. Naturally, a lively debate followed - staged partly in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" during the following year. His theory, which included the notion that white light was in fact a combination of colours, also explained chromatic abberation. Consequently, Newton turned his attention to telescopes and devised a new type of telescope that combined refraction with reflection. It is the first paper in this volume, which is the collection of original issues of the Transactions from 1672 and 1673, and thus a fascinating window to the period just after the publication of Newton's theory of light. Apart from Newton's answers to his critics on his new theory of light, and some letters of his critics (the Jesuit Ignatius Pardies in particular used the Transactions to publish his critiques on Newton's theory), this volume contains several additional papers by Newton and others on Newton's telescope. This type of telescope, with a cleverly constructed short tube, is still very popular among amateur astronomists. \"Newton built his reflecting telescope because he suspected it could prove his theory that white light is composed of a spectrum of colours. Colour distortion (chromatic aberration) was the primary fault of refracting telescopes of Newton's day, and there were many theories as to what caused it. During the mid-1660s with his work on the theory of colour, Newton concluded this defect was caused by the lens of the refracting telescope behaving the same as prisms he was experimenting with, breaking white light into a rainbow of colours around bright astronomical objects. If this was true, then chromatic aberration could be eliminated by building a telescope which did not use a lens - a reflecting telescope.\" (Wikipedia). Furthermore there are important contributions on, for example, astronomy and science by Flamsteed, Cassini, Hevelius, Boyle, Huygens and others, and natural history by Lister, and others. This volume contains the following contributions by Newton (which deviates from those listed in Gray, p. 45, who records one paper less): \"An accompt of a new catadioptrical telescope, invented by Mr. Newton\", pp. 4004-4009, with a folding plate; \"An extract of a letter, received very lately (March 19th) from the inventor of this new telescope\", pp. 4009-4010; \"Mr. Newton's letter to the publisher of March 26, 1672, containing some more suggestions about his new telescope\" pp. 4032-4035; \"An extract of another letter of the same to the publisher, dated 30 March. 1672. by way of answer to some objections, made by an ingenious French philosopher to the new reflecting telescope\", pp. 4034-4034; \"Mr. Isaac Newton's considerations upon part of a letter of monsieur de Berc\u00e9printed in the eighth French Memoire, containing the catadrioptrical telescope, pretended to be improv'd and refined by M.

Fritch was professor of geology at the Polytechnikum in Prague, and founder and member of several natural history societies in Bohemia. \u201cProfessor Antonin Fric &#x85;is considered by many to be the greatest Czech museologist, pedagogue and educationalist of the nineteenth century. He devoted his life to the Czech Museum (Museum of the Czech Kingdom, now the National Museum). From 1855, he was curator of the zoological collections. In 1864, he founded the Geological-Palaeontological Department and from 1871 was Professor at Prague University. In 1880, he was made Director of the Zoological and Palaeontological departments of the Museum. He travelled widely, including to Great Britain, the Mediterranean and the USA. His main works in zoology were monographs on European birds and Czech bats, fish and crustaceans. In palaeontology, he wrote on the stratigraphy and palaeontology of the Czech Upper Cretaceous, Carboniferous and Permian fauna. He also published several important books about the popularisation of geology and palaeontology\u201d (the Edinburgh Geologist, 38). The Fauna der Gaskohle contains the description and fine illustrations of many early vertebrates, notably fish, amphibians, and reptiles, generally described from well-preserved specimens. The last volume deals with invertebrates, including many myriapods, several spiders, some insects, crustaceans, and bivalves. Fritsch introduced many new names, most of which still valid today. Fritsch himself published the work, clearly in low numbers, and over a long period of time, which explains its rarity, especially of complete copies in original bindings. The last volume has 1901 on the title page, but Horn-Schenkling dates it from 1899. The total numbers of text illustrations as given by Fritsch on the title pages, and the actual numbers do not match, because Fritsch also counted figures with a b-number. This set has a label on the front pastedowns stating \"Presented to the Imperial College of Science Geology Department from the library of John Walter Gregory [name handwritten] 1934.\" Gregory (1864-1932) was a British explorer and geologist, perhaps best known for his survey of the Great African Rift Valley.

Most of the descriptions are based on material collected by the most famous shell collector of the 19th century, Hugh Cuming (1791-1865). \"...Reeve had become acquainted with Cuming, and Reeve\u2019s life was changed forever. ... Their association was such as to encourage Reeve to begin the Conchologia Iconica in 1843 primarily for description of Cuming material.

This copy, however, has 128 mammal plates on 126 sheets, and 199 bird plates, far more than in either the \"Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes\", or the \"Compl\u00e9ment\", which, according to Nissen (2462), should have 122 plates (1828-1830 ed.), or 181 plates (1838-1841 ed.). Given the contemporary bindings and the similar style, this is an unrecorded edition, rather than a mixed edition. Not counted in our total are portraits of Buffon and Lesson, three folded maps of the (then known) world, and plain plates of a furnace, a telescope, a burning glass, and a map of the Auvergne, as well as three plain plates of sperm, and two hand-coloured plates of humans, which were all in imitation of the original Buffon edition. Plate numbering is erratic, and often absent. For instance, in the Mammalia section there are 27 numbers used twice, and seven numbers used three times, 16 plates without a number, and six bis plates. In the mammals, 43 plates have no number, while 27 numbers remained unused. Initials of J.V. on tails of spines and the same initials embossed in gilt on front panels. We strongly believe this to be the naturalist Jules Verraux, who worked as \"naturaliste voyageur\" for the Museum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris. He travelled to South Africa and Asia to collect specimens. He is considered one of the greatest ornithologists of his time, and many birds, including an eagle, have been named after him by zoologists such as Lesson, Bonaparte, and Grandidier. Three plates in duplicate (second copies not counted). A few plates toned or spotted, the Auvergne-map torn with about a quarter missing, the title pages of oiseaux and mammif\u00e8res interchanged, otherwise a very good set of what possibly is a very rare edition.

The whole work was published over a period of more than 80 years, and written by many specialists in diverse fields of zoology and botany, such as Vaillant (herpetology), and Mabille (butterflies), etc., sometimes in collaboration with the Grandidiers. Some parts were never completed, or announced but not published; others were reprinted, with or without re-editing. A complete collation of all the parts published, and their variants, is still wanting. This set comprises the bird section, which is complete and includes the much later published supplement. Volume numbering (and, hence, spine numbering) is somewhat confusing. A collation is as follows: Volume XII. Histoire naturelle des oiseaux. Tome I. Texte (1879). pp. [i], [1]-779; Volume XIII. Tome II. Atlas I. (1879) 139 plates. According to Nissen, ZBI \"Die ersten 40 Taf. von Faguet, G\u00e9libert, Huet, Terrier wurden durch neue von Keulemans ersetzt\" In this copy, the non-osteological plates are all by Keulemans, except 7 and 71-72 (by Hu\u00ebt & Faguet), 41 and 41a (Arnoult), 55 (Faguet), and 87-88 (Louveau). In atlases II and III, all the full-colour plates are by Keulemans, except, perhaps, the egg-plates, which are not signed; Volume XIV. Tome III. Atlas II (1879) 139 plates (numbering consecutive); Volume XV. Tome IV, Atlas III (1881) 122 plates (consecutive).

This volume with some pencilled ornithological and linguistic annotations. Raymond Decary was a French naturalist, ethnologist, geologist, historian, and linguist in Madagascar. In botany and zoology a dozen genera and hundreds of species are named after him.

However, he is probably best known for his findings in the field of entomology, the study of insects, and is considered by many to be the father of modern entomology. Much of his enduring popularity is due to his marvelous teaching ability and his manner of writing about the lives of insects in biographical form, which he preferred to a clinically detached, journalistic mode of recording. In doing so he combined what he called 'my passion for scientific truth with keen observations and an engaging, colloquial style of writing'... His Souvenirs Entomologiques is a series of texts on insects and arachnids. He influenced the later writings of Charles Darwin, who called Fabre 'an inimitable observer'. Fabre, however, was a Christian who remained sceptical about Darwin's theory of evolution, as he always held back from all theories and systems. His special force was exact and detailed observation, field research, always avoiding general conclusions from his observations, which he considered premature\" (Wikipedia).

A key archaeological outcome of the 1st Congress, for example, was the first agreement to standardise the use of Stone Age terminology across all parts of Africa. While \u2018Prehistoric Archaeology\u2019 has been a primary focus of all congresses, the mixture of disciplines represented at the 1st Congress has given the organisation a decidedly multi-disciplinary heritage that continues to this day. As J. Desmond Clark noted in his address to the 8th Congress: \u201cBefore 1947, archaeologists in Africa worked usually in watertight compartments; immense distance often separated one lone worker from another and they rarely, if ever, met. The 1947 Congress was significant in that, for the first time, it brought together prehistorians, palaeontologists and geologists from one end of the continent to the other and it served to provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas.\u201d (http:\/\/www.panafprehistory.org\/en\/static\/history)."},{"post_author":"1","post_content":"London, G. & W.

The painting, once owned by Mr. Friedrich Burger, who ran an art gallery in Munich, had first been extensively described by Dr. Oscar Freiherr Lochner von H\u00fcttenbach in a paper in 1894, where H\u00fcttenbach clearly states that the painting should be attributed to Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Apparently Mr. Burger still had trouble selling the painting, because in January 1897, he let Friedrich Haller & S\u00f6hne try a completely new method of authenticating his painting; by means of X-ray. According to a newspaper article clipped from the \"Allgemeine Zeitung\", mounted on the backside of the card board, and dated in a contemporary hand \"26\/I 97\" (= January 26th 1897) this X-ray indeed proved that this was a true D\u00fcrer, marking the photographs for sale as the first known attempt to verify a painting's authorship by this revolutionary method. The story was considered so important, it was repeated at length in the New York Daily Tribune of 11 April 1897: \u201cA new test for old paintings. The genuineness of an Albrecht Duerer proven by X-Rays. The practical value of R\u00f6ntgen\u00b4s famous discovery lies in its revelations of the unseen. While the applications of this instrument of research have hitherto been confined almost entirely to surgical diagnosis, yet there are other important uses to which it can be put...\u201d The X-rays reveal the date 1524, whereas previously the work was thought to date from 1521, and a previously unknown Gothic text. This is the oldest known verification of a piece of fine art by the means of X-rays revealing information about an old masters paintings' history hidden behind layers of paint, varnish, and dirt. The present whereabouts of this painting are unknown. We presume it was lost during WWII, or (less likely) it is hidden away somewhere in a private collection. It was not until the 1920's that X-rays were regularly used in the analysis of old paintings. From the newspaper article we learn something interesting about the rarity of these particular X-ray photographs, too; as it states that only a few copies were sent to a handfull of distinguished people in Europe. \"The Queen Regent of Spain having been thus complimented, she sent her specimen to one of the academies of art in Spain, and it was the subject of favorable comment there.\" (2) the somewhat smaller scaled positive of the former number (21.5 x 15 cm), here the painting is depicted much more clearly with better contrast; (3) a 42-year-old woman's skull; (4) a man's hand, signed in the photographic plate \"Armin Fl\u00fcmthal - similar to the first X-Ray in history, depicting either R\u00f6ntgen's or his wife's hand\"; (5) the lower part of the body of a 13-year-old female with malformed legs; (6) a man's foot with a crocked grown fracture; (7) the pelvis of a 17-year-old woman with a deformed pin to fix a fracture; (8) the pelvis of a 12-year-old boy - all of which so far are negative proofs; (9) the large-scaled (life-sized?) positive of #4 above, stating the time of exposure of three minutes (!)

He was the inventor of a lavender distillate, \"the water of the Queen of Hungary\", which became very popular in European courts. Perhaps as a consequence he became the private pharmacist of King Louis XIV and was awarded the privilege of teaching chemistry at the Sorbonne, and at the University of Montpellier. Later he became intendant of the chair of chemistry at the Jardin du Roi (1680 to 1684). This book is his most important work.

Darwin had already conceived of his theory in 1839, but because of its expected strong effects upon biological sciences, as well as on ethics, religion and morality, publication was greatly delayed, mainly because Darwin thought it absolutely necessary to collect as much supporting evidence as possible. However, in June 1858, Darwin received a letter from Wallace containing a clear and concise rendering of the concept of natural selection. Darwin, who was not quite ready yet, was forced to publish his ideas, and Wallace, who still was out collecting birds and beetles in the Malay Archipelago, had to be given credits due. Darwin discussed the matter with Charles Lyell and John Hooker, and it was decided that three papers, one by Wallace, being his letter, and two by Darwin (a letter to Asa Gray, and an abstract of Darwin's manuscript), were to be read at the meeting of the Linnean Society of London on June 2, and to be printed in the 'Journal of the Proceedings' of the Society (Volume 3, pp. 45-62, dated August 30, 1858).

Bolk was a Dutch anatomist and embryologist who created the Fetalization Theory about the human body. It states that when a human being is born, it is still a fetus, as is indicated by its (proportionally) big head, its uncoordinated motility or its absolute helplessness, for instance. Bolk's theory generally holds that man has evolved into a sexually mature fetal ape. In response to certain characteristics such as reduced pigmentation, the position of the foramen magnum, the jaw length, and our poorly developed body hair, Bolk concluded that the ape-like ancestor of humans may have delayed or halted much of its development during its evolution. Therefore, in comparison to the other great apes, the adult human shows many fetal characteristics. Bolk postulated that the cause at the base of this (lack of) development is hormonal, and that this trait is specifically human. The influential British evolutionary embryologist Gavin de Beer (1899-1972) and the famous American palaeontologist, Darwinist, and malacologist Stephen Jay Gould (1941-2002) wrote about him and further developed this theory, which is now usually known as neoteny, and widely regarded as scientifically correct. This set contains all Bolk's papers, with the possible exception of some published around the time or after his rather sudden death. Papers were published in Folio Neuro-Biologica, British Dental Journal, The American Journal of Anatomy, Bijdragen tot de Dierkunde, The Lancet, Journal of Anatomy, Anatomische Anzeiger, Petrus Camper, Morphologisches Jahrbuch, Nederlandsch Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde, Psychiatyrische en Neurologische Bladen, Bulletins et M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9d\u2019Anthropologie de Paris, Verhandlungen der Anatomischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin, Verslagen van de gewone vergadering der Wis- en Natuurkundige Afdeeling, Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen, Archiv f\u00fcr mikroskopische Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte, etc., etc. A library stamp in the beginning of each volume indicates that the set was part of the Koninklijke Academie van Wetenschappen, but was discarded, probably because the society's library already contained all the periodicals in which Bolk's work was published. The presence of handwritten and\/or signed letters by the Scottish anatomist Arthur Keith, and Bolk\u2019s publisher, Gustav Fischer, are especially noteworthy. Apart from being a noted scientist, Bolk also was the founder of the Anatomical Laboratory of the University of Amsterdam. Later he became its Rector Magnificus. A research institute for international advice and research on sustainable agriculture, nutrition and health care is named after him. Bolk was a pioneer in establishing a relationship between nutrition, health, and height in humans. With the small, elegant bookplate of the author.

This 4to edition offers the complete work of all three authors, has excellent images, follows the Linnaean system, and is in all these respects superior to the 18th century editions. This edition, edited by Flourens and published by Garnier, is not in Nissen; in fact, of the \"Cuvier\" part there is nothing similar in Nissen at all. The \"Buffon\" section, including the parts on mammalogy and ornithology, was published in 12 volumes; the \"Cuvier et Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de\" section, with herpetology and ichthyology, and additional mammal and bird plates, was published in four matching volumes. The fine, hand-coloured plates are by, e.g. Travi\u00e9s, and Acarie Baron. According to Nissen (ZBI 705), the Buffon-part of a similar, but not identical work does not have 150 plates (per the title page, as in this edition), but 163. However, his collation differs widely from this set and doubtlessly refers to a different edition (and so does his number 704). In this set the Buffon part has several plates bound in at variance with the \"indication pour le placement des planches\", and does not have a plate of fossil teeth, and two bird plates (\"Le petit mouche et son nid\", and \"L'echasse Le tourne-pierre, l'huitrier\"), all called for in the index but never bound in, and indeed has 147 plates, including the maps, tinted frontispiece, and portrait; the index to the \"Cuvier\" part calls for a \"baleine\" plate in volume 1, but it is not included. Original red and black printed front wrapper of volume 11 bound in.

The work deals with the natural history of the Danube river, which runs from southern Germany into Austria, through Slovakia, Hungary, along Croatia, through Serbia and Romania, and along Bulgaria, towards the Black Sea. It flows through Regensburg, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade and numerous other cities. It is the longest river of Central Europe. Its fauna has many endemic elements, and its waters have been a major trading route since prehistoric times. Wood: \"Basic work on one of Europe's greatest rivers [...] in which [Marsigli] devoted much space to a study of the riverbed and of the waters, as well as to the flora and fauna, and geology and the mineralogy of the adjacent land.\" DSB: \"An early classic on the natural history of the River Danube with an account (vols. IV-VI) of the animals living in it and about its course, a description of the fishes, birds and their nests, the quadrupeds roaming the banks, etc.\". The volumes are devoted to cartography, astronomy and hydrography (Volume 1) with maps of the whole river and spurious astronomical observations [measurements of star positions (e.g. Polaris, Arcturus, Spica) at various places along the Danube (e.g. Vienna), Jupiter and the position of the Galilean moons (in several figures), the transit of Mercury, on 3 November 1697 and its track across the solar disc (figured), and lunar phases with 16 large figures showing the terminator relative to the moon\u2019s craters]; archaeology and history of the settlements, towns, roads and bridges (Vol. 2); mineralogy (Vol. 3);  fish fauna (Vol. 4), which includes one plate with shells, and two with turtles; avifauna (Vol. 5); and several other subjects, including meteorological and climatological observations, notes on the river's velocity, the insects occurring in and near the river, etc., etc. (Vol. 6). They are titled as follows: Tomus I, in tres partes digestus : geographicum, astronomicum, hydrographicum; Tomus II. De Antiquitatibus Romanorum ad ripas Danubii; Tomus. III. De Mineralibus circa Danubium effossis; Tomus IV. De Piscibus in aquis Danubii viventibus; Tomus V. De Avibus circa aquas Danubii vagantibus, et de ipsarum nidis.; Tomus VI. De Fontibus Danubii.

In several bibliographies the plate number is erroneously stated to be 284, which probably goes back to a counting error caused by inconsistencies in the numbering of figures and the distinction between engraved plates and text engravings. Complete copies have 283 plates, as should be concluded after carefully comparing the extensive plate listings.

PMM, 140","note":"The very rare first edition. \u201cThe Lettres provinciales (Provincial letters) are a series of eighteen letters written by French philosopher and theologian Blaise Pascal under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte. Written in the midst of the formulary controversy between the Jansenists and the Jesuits, they are a defense of the Jansenist Antoine Arnauld from Port-Royal-des-Champs, a friend of Pascal who in 1656 was condemned by the Facult\u00e9de Th\u00e9ologie at the Sorbonne in Paris for views that were claimed to be heretical. The First letter is dated January 23, 1656 and the Eighteenth March 24, 1657. A fragmentary Nineteenth letter is frequently included with the other eighteen. In these letters, Pascal humorously attacked casuistry, a rhetorical method often used by Jesuit theologians, and accused Jesuits of moral laxity. Being quickly forced underground while writing the Provincial Letters, Pascal pretended they were reports from a Parisian to a friend in the provinces, on the moral and theological issues then exciting the intellectual and religious circles in the capital. In the letters, Pascal's tone combines the fervor of a convert with the wit and polish of a man of the world. Their style meant that, quite apart from their religious influence, the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Adding to that popularity was Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and satire in his arguments. The letters also influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Brilliantly written by Pascal, the Provincial Letters would not have been possible without the work of theologians from Port-Royal; indeed, most of the arguments Pascal deployed were already to be found in Arnauld's Th\u00e9ologie morale des J\u00e9suites, something which led the Jesuit Nicolas Caussin to reply to Pascal's perceived libel. Pascal's main source on Jesuit casuistry was Antonio Escobar's Summula casuum conscientiae (1627), several propositions of which would be later condemned by Pope Innocent XI. Paradoxically, the Provincial Letters were both a success and a defeat: a defeat, on the political and theological level, and a success on the moral level. Thus, King Louis XIV ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied the Pope himself, provoking Alexander VII to condemn the letters. But that didn't stop most of educated France from reading them. Moreover, even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments. Just a few years later (1665-66, and then 1679), Alexander condemned \u2018laxity\u2019 in the church and ordered a revision of casuistical texts\u201d (Wikipedia, partly after PMM).

Andreas Friedrich Happe (1733-1802) was a well-known artist, engraver, and naturalist as well as a pharmacist. He was born in Aschersleben and died in Berlin in 1802. He published a number of books on pharmaceutical botany of which the most important is his 'Botanica pharmaceutica&#x85;' Berlin 1785 (-1806). He was also the artist for the plates of the first two volumes of Martini & Chemnitz 'Neues systematisches Conchylien-Cabinet'. However, he is better known for his botanical artwork.

The album was carefully crafted as a present at Ehrenberg's 50th anniversary as a doctor of science. Its artists are Ehrenberg's daughters Helene (1834-1890), Laura (1836-****), and Clara (1838-after 1905?), and his son Hermann Alexander (1840-****). Clara, the youngest daughter, contributed most; she is also the author of a work titled \"Unser Elternhaus: Ein Familienbuch f\u00fcr meine Geschwister und deren Kinder und Enkel\" (published in 1905). Clara must have been closest to her father; she also helped him with arranging and filing his huge collections of microscopic specimens (see Lazarus & Jahn, 1998, \"Using the Ehrenberg collection\"), and drew specimens of Foraminifera and other minute organisms. The work is divided into four parts: \"Jugendzeit\" (Youth); \"Africa\"; \"Heimath\"; and \"Neuere reisen\" (Later travels). \"Jugendzeit\" starts with a fine drawing of Ehrenberg's place of birth, Delitzsch in Saxony, a town virtually untouched during the Second World War. Today, most landmark buildings are exactly as drawn by Helene, some 150 years ago. This is followed by a suite of 13 photos (on three leaves) of Schulpforta, a boarding school of Hogwartsian proportions. Being a former Cistercian monastery, Pforta Abbey (built between 1137-1540) is a famous German boarding school for academically gifted children, now called Landesschule Pforta. Notable alumni include the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the mathematician and astronomer August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius, the historian Leopold von Ranke, the poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and, between 1809-1815, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg. A photo of Leipzig University (destroyed in WWII), from which Ehrenberg graduated in 1818, follows. His thesis dealt with fungi. The next chapter deals with Africa, in particular Egypt and the Red Sea region, including the Sinai dessert, which is represented by a fine drawing by Ehrenbergs daughter Clara, who contributed additional watercolour and pencil views of Tor and Massawa (Eritrea); as well as a 1860's photo of Cairo. Together with Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich (1796-1825), Ehrenberg travelled through the region twice, collecting natural history specimens. Unfortunately, Hemprich died of fever in Massawa. Returning to Germany, Ehrenberg was elected a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences and become an assistant professor at the University of Berlin (now Humboldt University - represented by two photographs). He published much of the results of his travels, describing hundreds of new species of animals and plants, mostly in the series \"Symbolae physicae\", in which Hemprich remained listed as second author. His travels through Russia, together with Alexander von Humboldt, are not recorded; the next illustrations (fine pencil drawings by Clara), are of Wismar (1831), Schoenebeck (1850), and the Biliner Felsen (a mountain near B\u00edlina, Czechia, also visited by Goethe). Another large photo shows Dresden, visited by Ehrenberg in 1844, Boltenhagen (1845; drawn by Clara) and Cambridge (1847; drawn by Clara). Ehrenberg visited Cambridge and Oxford; in Oxford he met Charles Darwin - they remained friends. The following sketch by Clara shows the view from Ehrenberg's house in Berlin, followed by photos from Venice (1853), Hamburg (1854) and a fine drawing by Helene of \"Das Grosse Schloss\" in Blankenburg im Harz (1856). Hermann contributed one fine, detailed ink drawing of the rear and garden of the \"Haus der naturforschenden Freunden zu Berlin\". Ehrenberg was a member of the Gesellschaft von naturforschenden Freunden (founded 1773). The building was later altered and then sold (1906); it no longer exists. This is followed by a large photo of the Institut de France, in Paris, a view from the Seine river that has not changed much in 150 years time. In 1832, Ehrenberg received the institute's \"Prix pour Physiologie exp\u00e9rimentale\". The \"Neuere Reisen\" starts with three views of Mount Vesuvius, Capri and Ischia (1858, all by Clara), an old, large photo of Rome's Circus maximus, a bird's eye view of Heligoland (1861), and a large watercolour view of the Jungfrau mountain in the Alps (1860). Next is a very accurate and delicate rendering of the Arctic-alpine plant Dryas octopetula, by Laura, who had married a botanist. This is followed by an oil painting on cardboard by Clara, \"Schledorf am Kochelsee. 1862\"; an unsigned watercolour (probably also by Clara) of \"Unsere Wohnung im Park zu Aigen bei Salzburg. 1862\"; another very fine plant drawing by Laura \"Cyclamen europaeum\", dated 1862, and more views of Central European places, including a watercolour of Nice, in southern France. This is followed by another suite of fine watercolours by Clara, and two more oil paintings in her hand, including a view on the Berner Alps, dated 1867. The final illustration is a mounted photo of the L\u00f6wenbr\u00fccke im Thiergarten bei Berlin (lion's bridge in the Berlin Zoo), which was built in 1834 and still exists. Loosely inserted are a) a drawing, presumably by Clara, of a wooden house, and b) a photo (ca. 1860-1870) of a street in Berlin, with a view towards the Marienkirche in Berlin Mitte. The use of photographs is peculiar; photographs made in or perhaps a few years previous to 1868 have been included to illustrate localities where Ehrenberg stayed long before photography had even been invented. Several, however, may have been made for this special occasion. Several pages were deliberately left blank, apparently to leave room for additional souvenirs, such as the early Berlin photo and the drawing of a wooden house.

(It) contains descriptions of 4,514 nominal species, the greater portion, approximately two-thirds, written by Valenciennes after the death of Cuvier in 1832\" (T. W. Pietsch). Nevertheless, Cuvier remained quoted as co-author. The preface of volume 9 contains Cuvier's eulogy by Valenciennes. \"...To-day the work of Cuvier and Valenciennes is indispensable to systematic ichthyology ... In many parts of the world people assisted Cuvier with notes, manuscripts, and particularly specimens. For many years the Jardin des Plantes was the center where all ichthyological materials were deposited. Thus, Cuvier was able to bring together the richest and largest contemporary collection of fishes. Althogether, his vast communication network, huge world-wide collections, and extensive ichthyological library, made Paris the center of ichthyology and Cuvier the foremost ichthyologist in the world...\" (T. W. Pietsch, in Archives of Natural History, volume 12). The number of species that are regarded as valid today, is immense. The plates are in the realm of the very best ever made; no ichthyological work equals the delicacy of colouring and precision of engraving. The plates of volumes 19 and 20 are not coloured; those in volume 6 are on smaller sheets, mounted to match; the smaller plate 245 is probably from another, octavo, copy. A complete collation is available upon request. Regarding text and plates this set is complete. This set is very reasonably priced as the text and plates are partly seriously affected by foxing.

Illustrated by select specimens of foreign and indigenous plants\"), and illustrator. This work is the illustrated narrative of his voyage through France, Switzerland, and -mostly- Italy. In the preface Duppa wrote \"...the author has taken some pain to be correct in his facts and has never indulged his imagination\". Indeed, his observations are detailed and correct. He even lists the travel hours and distances of each leg. Another notable feature is the author's interest in handwritings. Several plates show facsimiles of autographs and other writings. The work contains two indexes to the illustrations, namely one of the woodcuts and one of the engravings. The fine, very detailed engravings are not all on separate plates, but also present on text pages. For the appendix, Duppa lists five plates; however, there are six. There is no \"first\" edition of this title; this is a re-edited and very much expanded version of the author's \"Miscellaneous observations on the Continent\" (214 pp., 1825), which contained only the voyage through France and Switzerland. \"Travels on the Continent\" includes the Italian part - making up most of both the text and the illustrations.

All volumes except the first one in first edition (vol I in the 1803 second edition). Includes the very rare 11th and last volume. Johan Wilhelm Palmstruch (1770-1811) was a Swedish Captain in the cavalry and a botanical artist. The original drawings can be found in the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. This work has a very complicated and long history of publication - it took over 40 years to complete the publication. Because of the beauty of the illustrations, Palmstruch became known as the \"Swedish Sowerby\". Palmstruch had learned to draw from his teacher, Louis-Jean Desprez (1743-1804) and modeled this work after the \"Flora Danica\" and Sowerby's \"English Botany\". The co-editor of the first volume was Carl Wilhelm Venus (1770-1851). Authors of the text include, Conrad Quensel (1767-1806), Olaf Peter Swartz (1760-1818) and Gustav Johan Bilberg (1772-1844). After Palmstruch died (from volume 7 onwards), the artistic work was continued by Lars Levi Laestadius, A. J. Agrelius, P. F. Wahlberg, and others.

All plates in this collection are intact, as published, and in excellent condition. \"Southern Tibet\" is the scientific result of Sven Hedin's (1865-1952) third and most prosperous journey into Central Asia. From 1906 to 1908, Hedin \"crossed Persia and Afghanistan, entered Tibet, and identified the true sources of the Indus, Sutlej, and Brahmaputra rivers. He discovered and mapped the Transhimalayan Mountains, crossing the range eight times and overcoming formidable obstacles of winter weather, mountain passes never crossed before, and hostile local tribesmen, who kept Hedin prisoner for a time.\" (Encyclopedia of World Biography p. 252) Popular narratives of this expedition were published as Overland to India (1910) and Trans-Himalaya (1909-1913). The vast collection of maps, both historical (from Humboldt, for example, or several from Bernier's narrative dated 1670) and contemporary, as well as photographs and panoramic chromolithography make \"Southern Tibet\" a distinguished and desirable work. The \"last of the classical explorers,\" this book showcases Hedin in his prime as a great explorer, writer, and artist. \"His vigorous health, physical endurance, powerful will, endless patience, and apparently reckless courage many times brought him through seemingly hopeless situations. Using only simple means, he blazed trails through vast unknown areas, preparing the way for trained scientists.\" \"On all his lone journeys Hedin carried out continuous route mapping by means of carefully measured compass traverses with astronomic control. From points along the route line he sketched panoramas of the landscape with remarkable accuracy, often taking in the whole horizon. Together the route maps and panoramas give a very clear picture of the topography. This method enabled Hedin to produce, unassisted, a picture of the geomorphology of vast areas of Tibet which would otherwise have required an elaborate topographical survey.\" Hedin combined his route mapping with a systematic collection of rock specimens along all routes where rocks were exposed and made notes on their appearance in the field. Therefore the geological results of his journeys in Tibet were also pioneering. He made available the first knowledge of the widespread marine transgression over the Tibetan plateau during the later part of the Cretaceous, when the plateau was reduced to low relief.\" And yet Hedin's pioneering work didn't stop there. He was one of the first involved in botanical explorations in the area. As is noted in vol. VI, \"The main interest lies in the Tibetan plants since this great highland area is far from sufficiently explored; the Eastern Pamir also traversed by Dr. Hedin requires further botanical [research] as the few plants brought home in several cases were either new to science or at least new to the area.\" A full collation is as follows: Vol. I: xxxii (including title) 293 pp., plus one b&w photographic plate and 53 maps (10 folding); Vol. II: xi (including title), 330 pp., plus 82 illustrations in 58 plates (including one double-page chromolithograph and one fold-out) and 24 maps (five of which are two-page or folding); Vol. III: xi, 369 pp. plus 99 illustrations in 72 plates (including 8 chromolithographs, three of which are folding panoramas) and 31 maps (19 of which are folding); Vol. IV: xi (including title) 428 pp. plus 160 illustrations on 127 plates (including four photogravures) and 33 panoramas (nine of which are photographs and 24 of which are chromolithographs); Vol. V: 220 pp. (excluding title page in English) plus 11 b&w photographic plates and two double-page maps; Vol. VI: [3] preliminary leaves, part I \"Die meteorologischen Beobachtungen\" vii, 133 pp., part II \"Les observations astronomiques\" 86 pp. (including title pages), part III \"Botany\" pp. [1-101], part IV \"Bacillariales aus Innerasien\" pp.[105]-152, part V \"Algen aus Zentralasien\" pp.[153]-193, plus 11 specimen plates; Vol. VII: x, [1] leaf, 605 pp., plus 21 illustrations on 19 plates (eight of which are photogravures and two of which are landscapes drawn by the author) and 103 maps (26 plates of which are folding); Vol. VIII: xvi (including title page) 456 pp., plus 29 maps (25 of which are either double-page or folding); Vol. IX: [4] preliminary leaves, part I \"Journeys in Eastern Pamir\" pp. [4]-85, part II \"Ostturkische Namenliste\" pp. [87]-123, part III, \"Zur Geologie von Ost-Pamir\" pp. [125]-180, part IV, \" Eine Chinesische Beschreibung von Tibet\" pp. [1]-66, part IV \"Das Goldstromland\" pp. [67]-130, part V \"General index\" pp. [1]-176, plus 26 illustrations on 13 plates (seven of which contain 14 drawings by the author) and four maps (three of which are folding); Vol. X: \"Atlas of Tibetan Panoramas\" [2] leaves (including title page), 10 pp. plus 105 folio plates; Vol. XI: \"Maps I\" in loose folio sheets [1] (including title page) plus index map (one sheet), \"General map of central Asia and Tibet\" (one sheet - broken spine), \"General map of east Turkestan and Tibet\" (15 sheets), \"Special map of Dr. Sven Hedin's Route Through Tibet 1906-1908\" (26 sheets), \"General map of the great Kara-korum Glaciers\" (two sheets), \"Map of Dr. Sven Hedin's travels in Eastern Pamir\" (two sheets); Vol. XII: \"Hypsometrical maps in 52 sheets\" one sheet includes title page and index map, plus 52 maps in folio sheets.

A few plates are ethnographical; one is a portrait. The text was never completed. Some foxing (as usual) ranging from light to medium to only a few plates and mostly in the margins, other plates quite clean. A few with a small stain to one margin. Three spines of wrappers split at folds, two others with small defects only. Overall, still a very good copy, especially since these are always foxed to some degree.

Jan Commelin (1629-1692) died before the publication of Part I of his manuscript, and this is acknowledged on the title pages of Part I. As further explained there, the botanist, zoologist and anatomist Frederik Ruysch (1638-1731) edited the work and added some annotations. Commelin's nephew and successor, Caspar, wrote Part II. The work is of an outstanding quality, with beautiful plates in deep shades of grey and black. There are 20 plates depicting Aloes, but also many more exciting exotic plants. Part I with a few small, marginal spots, a few plates slightly age toned, but with strong impressions. Small hole in explanatory leaf to plate 79, some minor soiling to p. 218, contemporary handwriting (the Latin names of the species) in the margin of several plates. Part II with repair to the lower corner of fig. 88, traces of slight worming in the lower inner margin, but this is really unobtrusive. A faint half-circular water stain to outer margin of pp. 205-224 and index, somewhat stronger on figs 105-107, but also hardly distracting. In all, a very good copy of this rare and important work on the plants kept in the Amsterdam Hortus Botanicus, which still exists to this day at its original location. Nissen quotes a wrong number of plates, probably counting frontispieces as well. This copy is super complete with 225 numbered figs on 222 leaves, which is one plate more than usually quoted as the maximum, but that is probably because fig. 4 (Part II) has two versions, meaning there are two figures displayed on one leaf (the leaf was printed on both sides), the only plate that was done that way in this entire work. It remains unclear if all copies have this particular double plate, since very few mention it in their descriptions nor is there any remark by the bibliographers on this topic. Furthermore almost all plates show one species, and the figure number equals the number of plates, except that figs 42-44 (Part I) are on one plate, for a total of 112 numbered figs on 110 leaves.

BM(NH)]. The illustrations are more like original watercolours as only the outlines and shading of each fruit are - extremely lightly - printed, and the illustrations in different copies are similar, but nowhere near identical. The title translates as follows: \"Dutch pomology or illustrations and descriptions of distinct species of apples and pears which are cultivated in the Dutch regions. All drawn in colour and described after nature\". The foreword is signed by the author, Matthieu van Noort, and dated 22 December 1830. Van Noort (1768-1844), who studied law and was apparently a wealthy man, became known as a versatile and skilled artist, working as a painter, etcher, and sculptor. We could trace only two copies of his Pomologia on the market during the last 50 years, each varying in the number of plates. Landwehr calls for 84 plates. Our copy is without the last five plates mentioned by Landwehr but with an additional plate - \"Dirkjes-Peer\" - not mentioned by Landwehr. Nissen calls for 173 plates, but this must be an error. According to van der Aa, Van Noort worked on the Pomologia from 1830, when he was 62, until his death 14 years later. 21 instalments were completed. Assuming that each instalment consisted of four plates (backed up by the fact that the order in which each group of four plates are present is the same in our copy and the Landwehr collation, disregarding our plate 64 which is not in Landwehr, and because there are alternatingly four apples - four pears), the maximum number of published plates at the time of van Noort's death was probably 80 or 84. The last instalments were not completed due to lack of funds and consisted of an undisclosed number of plates. Their whereabouts are unknown. We have a single plate of one of those uncompleted instalments. According to van der Aa, several sets of the last instalments were given to B. Wttewaal, professor in rural economics in Leiden, and they may be in the collection of Leiden University or its botanical gardens. In any event, a copy with 80 plates is very rare indeed. The rarity of the work can be explained as follows: according to van der Aa, the plates were not for sale, but donated to friends and perhaps other people who showed interest. This is contrary to the 1830 title page, which states that the work was available at the Leiden book dealer C. C. Van Der Hoek. The foreword of this copy is signed in ink by van Noort. Provenance: the name Helena Leembruggen - Veenenburg handwritten in the top margin of the half-title. A few text leaves slightly age-toned, hinges a bit weak, otherwise a very fine, crisp copy.

He played a significant role in Viennese scientific and social life at the time and his years in Vienna were extraordinarily fruitful. In addition to his professorship, he was the director of the botanical gardens. He was knighted in 1774 for his services and contributions to botany, and became a baron in 1806.

Arguably the most important scientific journal of its time, with all the major discoveries in physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, biology medicine and history, it was widely read throughout the scientific world, being written in Latin. The Acta eruditorum was founded in Leipzig in 1682 (the present set thus is the rare start, including the first volume). Founders and first editors were Otto Mencke, and Gottfried Leibniz. Like the English 'Philosophical Transactions' and the French 'Journal des Savants', the 'Acta Eruditorum' contained excerpts from new writings (often letters, circulating among scientists), reviews, and original contributions. Some of the foremost scientists of their time made regular contributions. In particular Leibniz, and Jakob and Johan Bernoulli, published their important mathematical contributions in here. Leibniz published 36 articles in these volumes of the Acta Eruditorum, perhaps the most important being his work on integral calculus \"De Geometria recondita et Analysi Indivisibilium atque infinitorum,..\" in 1686, described in more detail below. The 1684 volume contains Leibniz's famous article on differential calculus in an exceedingly rare, unrecorded state. Dibner: \"First printing of this epochal work. (...) Fifteen years after Newton's first work in fluxions and nine after his own independent discovery, Leibnitz published the above, his first announcement of the differential calculus\". It is now known that four distinct issues exist, and this issue was unrecorded until recent. In the Norman copy, page 467 is in an uncorrected setting (known as the first state), with quite a few printing errors in the mathematical formula. In the copy described in Dibner's \"Heralds of Science\" (previously recognized as a first issue), the page is entirely reset, with corrections, but was recorded as the second 'state' or 'issue'. Our copy is similar to the Norman copy, with page 467 in an uncorrected state and can therefore not be a late issue. Interestingly, in our copy the plate next to page 467 differs from both Norman and Dibner: the letters \"M. Oct\" are printed at the top of the sheet underneath the plate number. It is still unclear which one is the true first. It is, however, certainly possible that this is the true first issue, we can think of little reason to add \"M. Oct\" to the plate in a later stadium. All plates in the 1684 volume have the month added, no other copies with this feature have been found. The 1684 volume in a very good copy in unusually crisp and clean condition, and in an attractive contemporary binding. In volume 5 (1686) Leibniz introduces his important integral calculus in \u201cDe geometria recondita et analysis indivisibilium atque infinitorum\u201d. Apart from these most famous articles by Leibniz, there are dozens of other articles by Leibniz and also by other famous scientists like the Bernoullis and Huygens. The articles and plates in this set illustrate the progress of science in many fields of knowledge: not only mathematics, but also human anatomy, natural history, alchemistry, astronomy, botany, mining, and archaeology, to name just a few. Of particular interest is the first description of a steam engine, by the French mathematician and inventor, Denis Papin (1647-1712) in the 1690 volume (pp. 410-41, and a plate). Two plates, 1688, plate X (to anothe Papin paper), and 1689 plate XV (to Valvasor's publication on the Cerkni&#x9a;ko jezero lake) lacking. Old library stamp on verso of title pages, removed paste on front pastedown. Some light uniform age toning as usual for this sort of paper and a few pages browned. In the 1686 volume the September issue ha a red wine stain covering various parts of text, but not effecting readability. The fine plate of Saturn and its moons is unaffected. A paper repair with loss of a few letters in the 1686 volume, pp. 325-326 (review of a German language thesis). The years 1692-1693 without preliminary (dedication) pages, most probably not issued. The years 1682-1683, 1686-1687, 1688-1699, 1690-1691, and 1692-1693 bound paired; 1684, and 1685 bound separately. All volumes with an old library stamp on the verso of the title pages.

Caspar Stoll was born in Hessen-Kassel between 1725 and 1730 and lived in The Hague and later in Amsterdam. William V of Orange-Nassau was the godfather of two of his children. He was \"commies ter Admiraliteit\" in Amsterdam and published several works on entomology. Jan Christiaan Sepp (1739-1811) was a bookseller and publisher and his publishing house produced some of the finest Dutch natural history colour-plate books of the 18th century.

There are in total 84 volumes in 4to with more than 2,000 engraved and lithographed plates, of which over 250 are hand-coloured or in chromolithography. This work contains the contributions of all the famous French naturalists of the 19th century, in many cases the first publication(s) of these authors, or at least in their first editions, and often their most important research and results. In the Annales, for instance, Cuvier published his important series on molluscan anatomy, while his rival Lamarck contributed with his monograph of the fossil shells of the Paris Basin. Ornithology is well-represented. For instance: De Blainville \"Le Dodo, autrement Dronte (Didus ineptus L.)\" with four lithographed plates one being a beautiful hand-coloured head of the dodo by G. de Bi\u00e8rre. Another important \"first\" is Geoffroy St-Hilaire's \"Descriptions des mammif\u00e8res nouveaux ou imparfaitement connus: famille des singes\" with eight lithographed plates of which two are coloured, one of which is the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes L.) and appears to be the first monograph, antedating that of Owen by seven years. A herpetological treasure is De Blainville's \"Description de quelques esp\u00e8ces de reptiles de la Californie\". Throughout each series there is also a great deal on entomology, and more on conchology\/malacology, including palaeontology, ichthyology and studies on crustaceans. Authors included are Cuvier, Valenciennes, Audouin, Lamarck, Becquerel, H. and A. Milne-Edwards, Brongniart, Jussieu, Tulasne, De Serres, Dum\u00e9ril, Thouin, Deleuze, Fourcroy, Vauquelin, a.o. Among the entomological titles, for example, are the following works by Lyonet: \"Anatomie de diff\u00e9rentes especes d'insectes\" (a long series, with plates by W. de Haan), Lacordaire's \"Essai sur les col\u00e9opt\u00e8res de la Guyane Fran\u00e7aise\"; an illustrated paper by Boisduval on Macrolepidoptera from Madagascar, Mauritius and R\u00e9union, inaptly titled \"Consid\u00e9rations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales\"; Audouin and Brull\u00e9's \"Description des esp\u00e8ces nouvelles ou peu connues de la famille des cicindel\u00e8tes\", with nice large hand-coloured plates, Raffray's \"Col\u00e9opt\u00e8res de la famille des paussides\"; Paul Gervais' paper titled \"remarques sur la famille des scorpions et description de plusiers esp\u00e8ces nouvelles de la collection du Mus\u00e9um\", and more. P\u00e8re David, the first westerner to see a deer named after him as well as the giant panda, published his travel diaries in the Nouvelles Archives, with many zoological observations, and this came with a string of papers by Vaillant, Sauvage, Heude, and others on the specimens of birds, fish, molluscs and other animals he collected. Over the years many papers included in this series have been sold separately for considerable prices. In all, it can be stated that these publications by the natural history museum of Paris do not only contain a great deal of zoological, palaeontological, geological and (bio)chemical observations and discoveries, but also provided a platform for many new ideas and concepts about how the natural world is organized and how it is developing.

This set ends with \"Nouvelles Archives series III, volume 9(1)\"; one more part and one more volume were published before the start of the fourth series. By then, however, the great era of descriptive zoology and botany, with large and lavishly hand-coloured plates, had come to an end.

BUTLER, who is well known as an ardent and careful student of the diurnal Lepidoptera, has undertaken, in conjunction with Mr. Janson as publisher, what will no doubt prove a very valuable and beautiful work. Many new species of Lepidoptera have been described by Mr. Butler himself amongst others without any figure: this practice is exceedingly inconvenient to those who attempt to identify species; and though, as Mr. Butler observes, it enables those who adopt it to \"call the beautiful their own\" to a larger extent than if they had to wait for figures, it is nevertheless a reprehensible proceeding, and has afflicted the conscience of one at least who has been guilty of it. Mr. Butler is a very skilful artist, and...it is a matter for congratulation that he has undertaken to make up for the shortcomings of past times, and intends to bring out once a quarter a part of his \"Lepidoptera Exotica\"...\" [E. R. Lankaster, commenting on parts I and II, in Nature, vol. 1: 17 (1869)].

Weighing over 6.3 kg (1 stone) and sold for the majestic sum of 72 Thaler, it deals with the smallest of all plants and animals, which are the building blocks (or, rather, grains) of many mountain ranges. The fine plates, made with the aid of a microscope, mainly show diatoms, radiolarians, and foraminifers in an endless variety, but also a few small mollusks, serpulorbids and, for instance, living tardigrades. Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (1795-1876) combined a near unsurpassed knowledge of zoology, comparative anatomy, geology, palaeontology and microscopy. Although perhaps better known for his work with Wilhelm Hemprich on the fauna of the Middle East and northeastern Africa, this actually is his most important work. Here, he showed that many rock types actually consist of nothing but the skeletons of unicellular microorganisms. This made him the father of - as the title of this work reads - micro-geology. \"Mikrogeologie\", however, also contains a wealth of information on microorganisms in soil, fresh water and seawater from all over the globe.

The basis of this work was laid by the German polymath Walther Hermann Ryff (ca. 1500-pre 1562), and this first subsequent edition was much expanded and updated by the German medical doctor Nikolaus Ager, or Acker (1568-1634). \"Ager studied medicine in Basel and became a medical doctor in Strasbourg, where he worked as a canon at St. Thomas Church ...

Alois Auer (1813-1869), born in Wels, Austria, was the director of the Kaiserlich-K\u00f6niglichen Hof und Staatsdruckerei (the Austrian State Printing House). In this publication he describes his \"discovery\" of nature printing, which he illustrates with some fine coloured examples. He uses dried plants, mosses, lace, snake skin, bat wing, minerals, fossils, etc to show off this \"new\" method of printing, which he believes at the time will change the history of printing once and for all. In reality nature-printing was invented at least 100 years earlier. He may have shed new light on the entire process and used it in different and innovative ways, but he does not talk about the true inventors in his texts, reffering only and frequently to his invention and the protection of the rights. He did however, by publishing this work in 4 languages, bring it to the general public, and others such as Constantin von Ettingshausen and Alois Pokorny would use his techniques in the years to come. \"Auer's method can only be used with objects with tolerably flat surfaces, such as dried and pressed plants, embroidery and lace, and a very few animal productions. The object is placed between a plate of steel and another of lead, both of which are smooth, and polished. They are then drawn through a pair of rollers under considerable pressure. When the plates are separated, it is found that a perfect impression of the object has been made in the leaden plate. This may be used directly as an engraved plate, but only if a very few impressions are wanted, for it is too soft to resist the action of printing presses for practical purposes\" [Wikipedia].

The botanical specimens collected during Cook's voyage were carefully depicted in watercolour by several artists, both during and after return of the expedition, under supervision of Banks and Solander. Between 1771-1784 18 selected engravers made at least 743 engraved copperplates of superb quality from the completed watercolour drawings. However, for various reasons Banks never got to publishing these plates and after his death they were bequeathed to the British Museum. It took until 1901 before the museum published a first selection of these plates, though a few of them had been used to illustrate other books. The present publication, with identifications by J. Britten, represents the first appearance of most of the images and is a magnificent overview of the first botanical study of Australian plants.

The entire set is complete in a contemporary uniform binding, but one volume in the bird section (\"Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux\") was bound recently, with a few labels renewed, and matching the original very well. Apart from some small defects and bumps to the bindings, a few volumes with some marginal worm traces (not effecting text), the set looks quite spectacular as a whole and is in very good condition. None of the bibliographies dares to name the number of plates, except Nissen, which lists 1,100 plates and six maps. This, however, is obviously incorrect and looking back in our records the number of plates varies from 1118 to 1143 plates, but it is not always clear with respect to the separately mentioned maps, portraits and\/or folding tables. If we count the portraits and large, folded maps\/charts too, our total is 1,153; the highest number on record. Some scuffing and rubbing to spines and boards, some volumes with small bumps and chips, three volumes (\"Mineraux\" section) with a few tiny wormholes to spine. Some scattered light stains or soiling, but never in the image area of the plates. Overall, a wonderful set in very good condition, in a very attractive binding and super complete state.

Up until 1693 the method of fluxions (which had been invented by Newton, and had been of great assistance to him in his mathematical investigations) was still, except to Newton and his friends, a secret. Newton admirers in the Netherlands informed him that the method of fluxions had been introduced there under the name of Gottfried Leibniz's \"Calculus Differentialis\". In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier published a tract in which he stated that Newton was by several years the first inventor of the calculus, and insinuated that Leibniz had stolen the idea. It was the start of a serious controversy between Leibniz and Newton, carried on by their followers for years after both famous mathematicians had died. In this article in the \"Acta Eruditorum\", Leibniz replied to Fatio de Duilleir by citing Netwon's letters and the testimony that Newton had rendered to him in the \"Principia\" as proofs of his independent authorship of the method.

Its publication exerted a powerful influence on the whole development of geology in France and secured for the two authors a distinguished place...\". Volume III is by Dufrenoy alone; the zoological atlas is by Bayle, and includes plates dealing with molluscs (mainly secondary - Mesozoic - ammonites and bivalves; some belemnites and gastropods, as well as several brachiopods and echinoderms); the botanical volume IV(seconde partie) is by Zeiller, with plates (bound in the rear of the second atlas) depicting fossil plants, principally from Carboniferous deposits. The Bayle and Zeiller Atlases are often lacking and thus very rare. A \u201cTome 3, deuxi\u00e8me partie\u201d was never published. Some regard Bayle' s atlas as part 2, but there is no indication of this in this work. Also, the \u201cTome 4, premi\u00e8re partie\u201d also remained unpublished, but similarly, Tome 4' s atlas is sometimes regarded as such. In any event, this set contains all that was published. Wrappers to text volumes partly detached and chipped at the edges. All bound volumes with very wide margins, those in wrappers uncut. Both atlas volumes in exceptionally good condition; clean and fresh, almost completely without spotting. The six large map parts with an old stamp on the linen covers, one stamp in one map corner, one map part with a small smudge, but otherwise clean. The attractive, very large map is very rare nowadays. In all, an excellent set. Cat.

Between 1779 and 1784 he was head of a factory in Deshima, then the only \u201ceye\u201d between Japan and the rest of the world. 18th and early 19th century Japan was much of a mystery to foreigners. This work unveils some its secrets. However, it does not only deal with the Japanese and their customs, but also reports on the geology of the country and in particular on the active volcanos. Two of the large, hand-coloured folded plates depict eruptions; of the Asama-Yama, and of a volcano in the Simahara district. The first of these plates, as well as a view of the island of Deshima with the Dutch factory were used again in Titsingh's \"Byzonderheden over Japan\", volume II (1825), see Landwehr.

Alexandre Leymerie wrote a successful Cours de Min\u00e9ralogie, and \u00c9lements de Min\u00e9ralogie et de G\u00e9ologie (both with several reprints) and spurious contributions to the geologie and paleontology of the Alsace, Lorraine, Aube, Haute-Garonne and other departments. This is his scarce and very important geological and palaeontological contribution to the Pyrenees. \"In Toulouse around 1850, a controversy on the structure of the Pyrenees opposed Frederic Petit, director of the Observatory to Alexandre Leymerie, professor of geology. The object of the debate was an assumption formulated by Petit, according to which the interior of the Pyrenees was practically empty. This  hypothesis was based on work carried out by the astronomer for the determination of Toulouses latitude. Leymerie  opposed this thesis vigorously. The debates that took place within the Toulouse Academy of Sciences but also in the local newspapers throw light on the organization of disciplinary spaces in the 19th century. The astronomer defended his method of research based on calculations; the geologist  talked instead about the soil. The emergence of geology, a less mathematized science, created conflicts with the astronomical practices of the 19th century centering on calculation. I will try to understand how the mountain was constructed as an object of controversy, the focus of different scientific practices. Whether it was dissected by calculation or by visual observation, the mountain was a space of disciplinary fighting and epistemological questioning\" J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lamy (Observatoire de Paris, abstract to the workshop \"The mountain as Object and Instrument of Science, Castasegna, 2007).

Snow was one of the first physicians to study and calculate dosages for the use of ether and chloroform as surgical anaesthetics, allowing patients to undergo surgical and obstetric procedures without the distress and pain they would otherwise experience.

It places Nice and the Savoy just outside France; the last map, dated 1776, shows Roman \"Gaule\", stretching all the way to the mouth of the Rhine and halfway to Switzerland.

La Flota operated between 1573 and 1790. Piet Hein was the first to successfully attack and defeat the Spanish fleet, a major naval achievement in itself. Even the famous Sir Francis Drake never succeeded, despite many attempts. Hein's men did not kill anyone and Hein allowed the Spanish crew members to march to Havana, even supplying them with food. Piet Hein brought the entire cargo home to the Dutch Republic, where the total value of the captured goods (mainly silver) was estimated to be around 10 million guilders (currently about 120 million euro). This was a huge moral boost to the Netherlands, then in its 60th year of the Eighty Years' War with Spain (ended in 1648) and renewed interest in trading in South America and the West Indies.

The author and publisher, Jean-Gilbert Salvage (1770-1813) was a French army doctor. The so-called 'Borgehese warrior' forms the basis of his work. It is a life-size Hellenistic marble sculpture portraying a swordsman, created at Ephesus about 2,100 years ago. \"It was found before 1611, in the present territory of Anzio south of Rome, among the ruins of a seaside palace of Nero on the site of the ancient Antium .... From the attitude of the figure it is clear that the statue represents not a gladiator, but a warrior contending with a mounted combatant. In the days when antique sculptures gained immediacy by being identified with specific figures from history or literature ... The sculpture was added to the Borghese collection in Rome. At the Villa Borghese it stood in a ground-floor room named for it, redecorated in the early 1780s by Antonio Asprucci. Camillo Borghese was pressured to sell it to his brother-in-law, Napoleon Bonaparte, in 1807; it was taken to Paris when the Borghese collection was acquired for the Louvre, where it now resides.\" Apparently Salvage was inspired by seeing the statue in Paris. All the anatomical and osteological renderings were designed by Salvage. Uncut, with the widest possible margins. Armorial bookplate of the Barante library on the front pastedown. Board edges a bit rubbed; cover at spine ends abraded, split in lower rear joint. Except for a few small, inoffensive spots internally clean. A very good copy.
